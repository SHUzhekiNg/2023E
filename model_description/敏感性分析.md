​		我们选择了California来测试我们模型的敏感性。我们选取两个指标 Regional industrial structure与 Limit magnitude，分别属于成本型和效益型用来测试我们模型的敏感性。
### Regional industrial structure

​		California的Regional industrial structure是0.2229，我们研究了Regional industrial structure从0.20变化到0.25时California的night-light intensity变化。从图表中我们看到，此时California的night-light intensity是0.52997，当Regional industrial structure变化为0.20时，night-light intensity降低为，相对变化率为。而从0.2229变化为0.20的相对变化率为，此时两个相对变化率的比值为。当Regional industrial structure变化为0.25时，night-light intensity提升为，相对变化率为。而从0.2229变化为0.20的相对变化率为，此时两个相对变化率的比值为。因此我们看到，我们的模型并不会因为Regional industrial structure的偏差而产生大的偏差。

​		California’s regional industrial structure is 0.2229. We have studied the change of California’s light-light intensity when the regional industrial structure changes from 0.20 to 0.25. From the chart, we can see that the night-light intensity of California is 0.59146 at this time. When the regional industrial structure changes to 0.20, the night-light intensity decreases to whatwhatwhatwhat, and the relative change rate is. The relative change rate from 0.2229 to 0.20 is whatwhatwhatwhat, and the ratio of the two relative change rates is. When the regional industrial structure changes to 0.25, the night-light intensity increases to whatwhatwhatwhat, and the relative change rate is whatwhatwhatwhat. The relative change rate from 0.2229 to 0.20 is whatwhatwhatwhat, and the ratio of the two relative change rates is whatwhatwhatwhat. Therefore, we can see that our model will not deviate greatly due to the deviation of the regional industrial structure.

### Limit magnitude

​		California的Limit magnitude是6，我们研究了Limit magnitude从5变化到7时California的night-light intensity变化。从图表中我们看到，此时California的night-light intensity是0.52997，当Limit magnitude变化为5时，night-light intensity降低为，相对变化率为。而从6变化为5的相对变化率为，此时两个相对变化率的比值为。当Limit magnitude变化为7时，night-light intensity提升为，相对变化率为。而从6变化为7的相对变化率为，此时两个相对变化率的比值为。因此我们看到，我们的模型并不会因为Limit magnitude的偏差而产生大的偏差。

​		California’s limit magnitude is 6. We have studied the change of California’s light-light intensity when the limit magnitude changes from 5 to 7. From the chart, we can see that the night-light intensity of California is 0.59146 at this time. When the limit magnitude changes to 5, the night-light intensity decreases to whatwhatwhatwhat, and the relative change rate is whatwhatwhatwhat. The relative change rate from 6 to 5 is whatwhatwhatwhat, and the ratio of the two relative change rates is whatwhatwhatwhat. When the limit magnitude changes to 7, the night-light intensity increases to whatwhatwhatwhat, and the relative change rate is whatwhatwhatwhat. The relative change rate from6 to 7 is whatwhatwhatwhat, and the ratio of the two relative change rates is whatwhatwhatwhat. Therefore, we can see that our model will not have a large deviation due to the deviation of Limit Magnitude.
