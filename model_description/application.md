### Protected location		

​		For a protected land location, we choose Wyoming. Wyoming is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the federal government, generally protected for public uses.
​		Wyoming is the least populous state despite being the 10th largest by area, with the second-lowest population density after Alaska. And it’s population density we get is 5.9 per $km^2$. Since the sparse population, it's GDP is only 41510.2 million dollars per year. Without much demand for transportation, it's local bus deadline is 5 pm, which largely reduce it's demand for road illumination.  The nightlife index is only 37, since it's closely related to the indicators above. This may account for the low power consumption, which is only 128.9 kWh.  
​		Today Wyoming's economy is largely based on tourism. So it’s tertiary industry percentage of GDP is similar to New York, which is one of the most prosperous city in the world. And the detailed data for tertiary industry percentage of GDP is 0.247. 
​		To support it's tourism, people should work for more hours, so we can see it's  working hour is 40.3 hours per week.

​		Due to it's geographical position,  it's annual precipitation is 390 millimeters.

​		It's limiting magnitude is 8.3, which means you can see several faint planet.

​		According to the indicators we mentioned before, it's night-light intensity score in our model is 0.0507, which ranks the second-lowest in our selected locations. This shows that our model's application for protected location  is in line with the reality.
