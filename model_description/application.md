### Protected location		

​		For a protected land location, we choose Wyoming. Wyoming is a state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United States. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the federal government, generally protected for public uses.
​		Wyoming is the least populous state despite being the 10th largest by area, with the second-lowest population density after Alaska. And it’s population density we get is 5.9 per $km^2$. Since the sparse population, it's GDP is only 41510.2 million dollars per year. Without much demand for transportation, it's local bus deadline is 5 pm, which largely reduce it's demand for road illumination.  The nightlife index is only 37, since it's closely related to the indicators above. This may account for the low , which is only 128.9 kWh.  
​		Today Wyoming's economy is largely based on tourism. So it’s tertiary industry percentage of GDP is similar to New York, which is one of the most prosperous city in the world. And the detailed data for tertiary industry percentage of GDP is 0.247. 
​		To support it's tourism, people should work for more hours, so we can see it's  working hour is 40.3 hours per week.
​		Due to it's geographical position,  it's annual precipitation is 390 millimeters.
​		It's limiting magnitude is 8.3, which means you can see several faint planet.
​		According to the indicators we mentioned before, it's night-light intensity score in our model is 0.0507, which ranks the second-lowest in our selected locations. This shows that our model's application for protected location  is in line with the reality.

### Rural community

​		For a rural community, we choose Nevada. 
​		Nevada is the 7th-most extensive, the 32nd-most populous, and the 9th-least densely populated of the US states. It's population density we get is 28.3 per $km^2$. And it's working hour belongs to the average level in US.
​		As we all know, Las Vegas is located in Nevada. This may account for it's night-life index of  up to 70.
​		It's power consumption is 362.8, far more than protected locations, but similar to other locations.
​		Legalized gambling and lenient marriage and divorce laws transformed Nevada into a major tourist destination in the 20th century, which promote local economy. It's GDP is 194486.6 per year and it's tertiary industry percentage of GDP is 0.284. The early deadline of bus is mainly because of tourism. It's local bus deadline is 3 pm.
​		Nevada is the driest state, and it's annual precipitation is 241 millimeters.
​		It's limiting magnitude is 8.3, which means you can rarely see faint planet.
​		According to the indicators we mentioned before, it's night-light intensity score in our model is 0.0760, which ranks above all the protected locations in our selected locations, but below all the more prosperous states. This shows that our model's application for rural community is in line with the reality.
