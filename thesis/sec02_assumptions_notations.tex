\section{Assumptions and Justifications} 
To simplify the problem, we make the following basic assumptions, each of which is properly justified.
Assumption 1: 
Justification: 
Assumption 2: 
Assumption 3: Night-time light intensity is closely related with economics.
Justification: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item We assume all the light pollution is from night-time light, so we just need to consider night-time light intensity.  

    \textbf{Justifications: }According to the Wikipedia\cite{wiki}, the definition of light pollution is the presence of anthropogenic artificial light in otherwise dark conditions. 

    \item Citizens didn't take deliberate action to reduce the light-pollution.
    
    \textbf{Justifications: }To simplify the problem, we didn't take people's awareness of light-pollution into account.

    \item Night-time light intensity is closely related with economics.
    
    \textbf{Justifications: }Fractional logit models\cite{fractional_logit_models} show that, similar to other types of pollution, both population and GDP are significant explanatory variables. 
\end{itemize}
