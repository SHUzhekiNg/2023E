\section{Basic Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
In 2017, the worst hurricane to ever hit the United States territory of Puerto Rico left the island with severe damage and caused over 2900 fatalities. The combined destructive power of the hurricane's storm surge and wave action produced extensive damage to buildings, homes, and roads, particularly along the east and southeast coast of Puerto Rico. The storm, with its fierce winds and heavy rain, knocked down 80 percent of Puerto Rico's utility poles and all transmission lines, resulting in loss of power to essentially all of the island's 3.4 million residents. In addition, the storm damaged or destroyed the majority of the island's cellular communication networks. The electrical power and cell service outages lasted for months across much of the island, and longer in some locations. Widespread flooding blocked and damaged many highways and roads across the island, making it nearly impossible for emergency services ground vehicles to plan and navigate their routes. The full extent of the damage in Puerto Rico remained unclear for some time; dozens of areas were isolated and without communication. Demands for medical supplies, lifesaving equipment, and treatment strained health-care clinics, hospital emergency rooms, and non-governmental organizations' (NGOs) relief operations. Demand for medical care continued to surge for some time as the chronically ill turned to hospitals and temporary shelters for care.
