\section{Strategy Making and Implementation}


\subsection{Literature Review}
Light pollution is a serious problem with implications for wildlife, human health, scientific research, energy consumption, global warming, and the ageless pastime of observing the night sky. Pristinely dark skies are very scarce in the developed world and most of the world's population—and nearly all of those living in the EU or the US—live under skies with at least some light pollution.
