\section{The EWM-TOPSIS Model: }

\subsection{Indicators of the Model}
We selected 8 indirect indicators as evaluation indicator variables to evaluate the night light level of the city,
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Entropy Weight Method (EWM) }
The entropy weight method is a multi-criteria decision-making method that is used to determine the relative weights of different criteria in a decision-making process.

We use the entropy weight method (EWM) to get the weight of indicators.


\subsection{The TOPSIS Method}
The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a multi-criteria decision-making method that is used to determine the best option from a set of alternatives based on multiple criteria.
