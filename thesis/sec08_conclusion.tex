\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a detailed model in order to analyze the light pollution objectively. We selected 9 indicators to establish our optimized EWM-TOPSIS method and it is realistic in our 12 selected locations, and we make some strategies based on our indicators. Our strategies aims at three aspects: technology, regulation and residents' awareness. Moreover, we address our strategies into two states and show significant effect.

In the future, with development of technology, comprehensive regulation and awareness of light pollution, the light pollution will become controllable.
